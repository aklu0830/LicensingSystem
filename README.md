# Hyperlink Licensing System

## What is this?

I've created an intuitive licensing system which allows plugin developers to easily secure their plugins. It works in conjunction with an API written in Java that can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/aklu0830/Hyperlink-Licensing-System).

## Installation

1. Ensure that Python 3.7+ is installed on your computer along with MySQL Workbench (or other database management software), along with MySQL Server 8+
2. Unzip file and open the Licensing System directory in your terminal.
3. Execute ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
4.
